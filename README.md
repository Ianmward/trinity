# Trinity Continuum

Unofficial Foundry Virtual Tabletop implementation of the Trinity Continuum Core RPG, by Onyx Path Publishing. The system currently supports Trinity Adventure in addition to Core (as it shares the same mechanics), but not yet Aeon or Aberrant.

## Info

This system was built on the Boilerplate system, w/ elements from party-overview (https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/party-overview). This is a beginning work by the system author: Expect errors, bugs, and poor coding in general.

## How to Use

Due to IP concerns, this system is not playable on installation. It requires the creation of system elements (as Items) that can be added to new characters. The following elements must be created:
* Skills
* Paths
* Contacts
* Edges
* Specialties
* Skill Tricks
* Gifts
* Weapons
* Armor
* Stunts
* Artifacts
* Bonds

Information on each of these elements can be found in the Trinity Continuum Core Rulebook, and other Trinity products.

## Other Notes

The Actors directory has a "Party Overview" button that launches a window to keep track of party Momentum, and the party's aspirations.
